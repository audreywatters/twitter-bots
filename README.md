## Bots of Conviction

A Twitter Bot Workshop at University of Mary Washington's DTLT
April 2017

**Description:**

In 2014, Twitter admitted that as many as 23 million of its active users are bots. Here's your chance to join the ranks by building your own. But the focus of this workshop is building a specific kind of Twitter bot, one that Davidson College professor Mark Sample has called a "protest bot" -- "A computer program that reveals the injustice and inequality of the world and imagines alternatives."

This workshop will help you build a Twitter bot with a purpose -- something topical, something oppositional. We'll talk about data sources, ethics, and the politics of tech. No programming experience necessary.
